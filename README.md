# WolfDec

A Simple Wolf RPG File Decryptor capable of decrypting all recent versions of *.wolf files, independent of the system locale.  

The decryption is done using a slightly modified version of [DxLib](http://dxlib.o.oo7.jp/index.html).  

## Usage

Just drag and drop one or more *.wolf file(s) onto the executable to extract them.  
Or run it like this: `wolfdec *.wolf` in the `Data` folder.
